provisions/files/jenkins/plugins is intended to be a caching folder.

Since some jenkins plugins can be quite large, the provision script: 
install-jenkins-plugins.sh contains a list of all the desired plugins, 
and will download those plugins to this folder during provisioning so they 
can be installed faster during subsequent provisions.

In order to keep git tidy, additions to this folder are ignored.
