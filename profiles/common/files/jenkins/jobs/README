This folder is intended to contain the jenkins jobs you want installed on the 
instance.

For every .xml file in this folder, install-jenkins-jobs.sh will attempt to 
use that .xml to create a Jenkins job.

In order to add a job to this folder, navigate to the config.xml for your job
(commonly in /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/JOB_NAME/config.xml) and use the XML from 
that file to create a new .xml here called JOB_NAME.xml, where JOB_NAME is the 
name that job should have.

Job names should not have spaces, because that's bad for everyone (such as API 
consumers).  In order to simulate spaces in a job name, use a dash.

Why a dash instead of an underscore?  Because sometimes a text cursor looks like 
an underscore, which can make it difficult to visually determine whether the 
job name follows the "no spaces" convention correctly.

A sample job called 'whoami' is included.  The results of this job should 
provide version numbers for some installed software.
