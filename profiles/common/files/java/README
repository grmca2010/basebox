As one explores how to load environment variables, one will discover the file 
/root/.bashrc will attempt to load the file /etc/bashrc.  When one then opens 
the file /etc/bashrc, one will see a comment:

# It's NOT a good idea to change this file unless you know what you
# are doing. It's much better to create a custom.sh shell script in
# /etc/profile.d/ to make custom changes to your environment, as this
# will prevent the need for merging in future updates.

When I checked out the /etc/profile.d folder, I noticed that there were 
already q few files in there.  So this is probably a good place to put a 
script that you want to run every time a shell is opened.
